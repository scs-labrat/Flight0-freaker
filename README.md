## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: The project is written in Python, so you'll need Python 3 installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python's package manager to install dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash

   cd Flight0-freaker
   ```

Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

``` 
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

(If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can skip this step or create one with the necessary dependencies.)


## Running the Project
Start the ADS-B Server:
Run the adsb_server.py script to start the ADS-B server:

```bash

python adsb_server.py
```

## Start the Python Web Server:
In the same directory, start a Python web server to serve the web interface:

```bash

python -m http.server 8000
```
Access the Web Interface:
Open your web browser and visit the following URL to access the homepage:

```bash

http://localhost:8000/
```
